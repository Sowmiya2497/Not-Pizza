# Not-Pizza
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) to classify images in one of two types - pizza or not pizza.
The network was trained using data from the UKBench Dataset(negative samples) and images of pizzas downloaded from
Google Images(positive samples). Uses keras and OpenCV libraries.
